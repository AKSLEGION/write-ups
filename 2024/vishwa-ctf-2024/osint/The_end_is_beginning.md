# OSINT/ The end is beginning:
## DESCRIPTION

Me and my friends just finished our final semester of B.Tech, so we decided to have a trip somewhere, but due to some reason, many of them were not available for the trip, but we were all ok as less is more. As the trip was about to end, one of my friends said we should try scuba diving here. I was scared of that, but my friends said, If you don't risk anything, you risk everything. Seriously, why do we have to risk our lives for half an hour? It's impossible for me, I said. But they motivated me all night, and then it was time for the dive. I screamed, Impossible is not a word in my vocabulary, and dived in. After all this, when I came back to my room, I realised I was low on money, so I called and asked my father for some help by singing something like this:
Iâ€™d be gone to my dad
And ask for some cash
I ran ......

All the Hustle towards the trip was worth it, as we enjoyed it a lot and made some awesome memories throughout the trip.

Flag format: VishwaCTF{My Name according to story_Amount I got in figures}
## Solution

This challenge was pretty straight forward:
We just googled this as that seemed to be heard somewhere:

Iâ€™d be gone to my dad
And ask for some cash
I ran

And got this link

And in the lyrics itself the amount is given and the name of the protagonist is Paradox

And so is the Flagâ€¦ðŸ˜Š
	
**Flag**: `VishwaCTF{Paradox_5000}`

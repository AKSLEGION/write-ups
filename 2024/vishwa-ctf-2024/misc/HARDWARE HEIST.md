# WRITEUP FOR MISC / HARDWARE HEIST 

Download the attachments of this chall. In it, there is a file named “BINARY INPUT.txt” which contains some binary text.

On converting this binary text to ASCII by setting byte length 7, we get the inner leetstring of the flag, that is “h4ck325_5uck_47_h42dw423”. 

So our final flag is `VishwaCTF{h4ck325_5uck_47_h42dw423}`  

That’s it :)

## Solution

This Challenge was very beautifully challenge framed by the authors.

First of all we were not given anything in the challenge other than the alias name so real challenge lies there only

We found a twitter account having the same alias after spending our 1 hour

twitter account: https://twitter.com/h3ck3r_h3_bh41/

Then we spent too much time in searching for keywords and all about that is given in the text like exam cookie chicks aliens â€¦

And finally after a real and intense work of doing osint we found an account

https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=husky%20woof%20woof&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=O~%3A

Then using above we searched for the place and found out to be tadoba.
